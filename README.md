# Word-Generator

Aim : Create a random word with a length supplied by the users and displayed back onto the html page

Advantages : Introduction to callback functions and event listeners, accessing html elements in js, changing html elements with js, and helper functions

First version : User inputs length in window prompt

Second version : User inputs length in text label; an event listener for the ENTER key is not set so the word is generated when the GENERATE RANDOM WORD button is clicked
