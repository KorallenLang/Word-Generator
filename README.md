# Word-Generator

Aim : Create a random word with a length supplied by the users and displayed back onto the html page

Advantages : Introduction to callback functions and event listeners, accessing html elements in js, changing html elements with js, and helper functions

First version : User inputs length in window prompt

Second version : User inputs length in text label; an event listener for the ENTER key is not set so the word is generated when the GENERATE RANDOM WORD button is clicked. The past user input for length are stored in the text label and visible when the user clicks to enter a new length
